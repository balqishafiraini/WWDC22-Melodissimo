#  INTRODUCTIONS
Hello, my name is Balqis and this is Melodissimo, a Playground that optimized display in iPad.
Melodissimo is my first Playground, Melodissimo. This also my first project with SwiftUI.
In this Playground, we can learn how to play Melodica. In Melodissimo there are Melodica tiles that we can play it like virtual Melodica. The Melodica tiles from learning feature has numeral notation label in the tiles, to help user know which tone that they pressed.
Furthermore, Melodissimo also has quiz feature. In quiz feature there will be some question that ask user, which numeral notation that belongs to specific tiles. The answer button is like Melodica tiles but without numeral notation label.
I'm truly happy when I made this Playground. Because there's a story behind that. The story is about my school memories when I never have Melodica beacuse my parents couldn't afford it that time. But now, I have it on my own. The happy feeling when I play my own Melodica, I want to express it by make a Playground that based on Melodica.
I hope people can enjoy this Playground and feel the same happiness way like I do.
